## How it works?

When you subscribe the Matomo add-on, we automatically setup a PHP instance based on the latest Matomo release. It comes with the required MySQL database and an optional Redis cache.

We have chosen to let you see and manage these companion add-ons in the Console so that you could adjust them to your needs. You can change their settings and use the Clever Cloud ability to migrate from an S flavored database or cache to an L or XL if required. You can also activate auto-scalability (horizontal and/or vertical scaling).

By default, Matomo on Clever Cloud comes with small sized resources:

- PHP Nano
- MySQL XXS BigStorage
- Redis S

We've already integrated the Clever Cloud SSO, so you can login directly into your Matomo instance from the Console, start to integrate your website, create different users.

## Create Matomo add-on

### From the Console

1. Create a new add-on by clicking on the **Createâ€¦** dropdown in the sidebar and then **an add-on**.
2. Select the Matomo add-on.
3. You can skip linking the add-on to an application, it won't be needed.
4. Enter the name of your Matomo add-on and select the zone where you wish to deploy it.
5. It's done!

### Using the CLI

Make sure you have `clever-tools` installed locally. Please refer to the [setup guide](/developers/doc/cli/install/) if needed. In your terminal, `clever addon create addon-matomo <name> --region <region> --org <org>` (`--org` and `--region` are optional). You'll get URLs to manage your Matomo instance:

```
$ clever addon create addon-matomo myMatomo
Add-on created successfully!
ID: addon_xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

Real ID: matomo_xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
Name: myMatomo

Your Matomo is starting:
 - Access it: https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-matomo.services.clever-cloud.com
 - Manage it: https://console.clever-cloud.com/addon_xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

/!\ The addon-matomo provider is in beta testing phase
```

Refer to the [Clever Tools documentation](/developers/doc/cli/addons/) for more details on add-on management.

## Accessing the Matomo interface

Once you created your add-on, open the management URL or use the `Access Matomo` link in the Matomo dashboard from the Console. To authenticate, you'll only need to use your Clever Cloud account.

## Configure your Matomo instance

Once you accessed your Matomo interface, we can start configuring it. A custom Clever Cloud configuration is automatically installed on your instance during the provisioning.

This configuration helps you to benefit from optimizations by using a Redis cache by default.

### Using your Matomo

If you're new with Matomo, you would probably want to read the Matomo's guides on [the official documentation](https://matomo.org/guides/).

## Matomo plugins

Your Matomo instance comes with a list of pre-installed plugins. As a managed instance, our Matomo add-on won't let you bypass the installation process. Installed plugins already allows a quite advanced use of Matomo, but if you wish to install a specific plugin that's not in your instance, feel free to contact our support team.

### When activating a deactivated plugin

Keep in mind that some plugins might consume more resources than you have by default on your PHP instance, since some PHP processes can take a long time, depending on what you are doing.

If you activate a deactivated by default plugin (like [GoogleAnalyticsImporter](https://matomo.org/guide/installation-maintenance/import-google-analytics/)):

- Scale your PHP app
- Disable auto-scalability for the PHP app
- Scale your Matomo MySQL add-on

If you activate the plugin while enabling auto-scalability, your PHP instance will restart with default settings when scaling, therefore disabling the plugin and killing the process.

Plugins can be browsed from [Matomo own plugin repository](https://plugins.matomo.org/).

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Plugin files are removed every time your instance reboots. **This means you have to reinstall them all again after every reboot.** This is temporary, and it is something we plan on improving as soon as we can.

### QueudTracking

By default, the `QueudTracking` plugin is enabled on Matomo instances, with a queue size of `25`. This means that the plugin stores 25 visits in a queue before they appear in Matomo. This helps to prevent the server from receiving too many request at once. You can change this setting by modifying the **Number of requests that are processed in one batch** parameter in **Administration->System->General settings**.

## Delete old archive

By default, Matomo isn't configured to delete the data that it receive. This can cause the databases to accumulate a lot of old data that may not be useful anymore and completely fill the databases.
To resolve this issue, you can setup and automatic deletion of old achives in Matomo settings.

To do this, you must go to the **Anonymize data** menu in **Administration->Privacy->Anoymize data**. You have two option you can activate to delete old achives, `Regularly delete old raw data` and `Delete old aggregated report data`. When you activate one of those options, you can select how old the date needs to be for it to get deleted. When one of the two options is activated, you can schedule the frequency (every day, month, year) at which you wish to delete the data in **Schedule old data deletion**.

## Security and updates

The Matomo add-on is a fully managed application, you don't have to select a particular version. Clever Cloud updates it for both features and security, and manages it continuously to apply regular version upgrades. After being updated, you Matomo add-on could need to be restarted.

## Plans

Matomo on Clever Cloud is the easiest way to set it up, but you can go further and adjust the flavor of your instance, database or cache independently. We provide [different plans for PHP, MySQL and Redis](https://www.clever-cloud.com/pricing/).

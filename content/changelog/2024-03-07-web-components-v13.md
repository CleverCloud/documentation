Clever Cloud's [Web Components](/doc/clever-components/) v13 are available, with bug fixes, refactoring, and new features. We introduced new possibilities to highlight form fields (larger labels, with color), paving the way for our new add-on/application creation process. 

A standardized API is used for UI components that depend on a smart component. It includes a `state` property receiving state type: `loaded`, `loading`, `error` and data. Latest smart components no longer rely on `rxjs`, making them easier to maintain.

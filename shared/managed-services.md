Add-ons are managed services, meaning that users have **standard access** to the database. Some operations like databases and users creation, as well as some settings modifications aren't available by default. This ensures optimal performances and security for managed services as configured by Clever Cloud.

If you think your system might require more advanced administrative access, [contact Clever Cloud support](https://console.clever-cloud.com/ticket-center-choice) to explain your use case, and we will work with you to find a solution.

Starting today, new Otoroshi add-ons deployed on Clever Cloud will expose API related environment variables as service dependencies:

- `CC_OTOROSHI_API_URL`: the URL of the Otoroshi API
- `CC_OTOROSHI_API_CLIENT_ID`: the API key to access the Otoroshi API
- `CC_OTOROSHI_API_CLIENT_SECRET`: the API secret to access the Otoroshi API

Thus, you'll be able to link the add-on to an application and get the API URL and credentials as environment variables.

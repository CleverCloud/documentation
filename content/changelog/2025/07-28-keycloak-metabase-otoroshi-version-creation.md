You can now set the version of Keycloak, Metabase and Otoroshi at creation time, from a list of supported and tested releases. It works from the [Clever Cloud Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com/), [API](/api) and [Clever Tools](/doc/cli). For example:

```bash
clever addon create keycloak --addon-version 26.2.5 myKeycloak
```

If you don't provide a valid version, supported values are printed in the error message.

description: Console update with new icons for the documentation
---

Among other changes under the hood, in the side menu when consulting an app, the link to the documentation is now:

* functional for all types of application
* more precise depending on the type of application (e.g. PHP app vs. static app)
* now accompanied by a small icon to boost visibility
* also effective for add-ons

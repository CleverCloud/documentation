## Requirements

If you need an example source code, init a new project (you'll need [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)):

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest myStaticApp classic
```

### Automatic build

Docusaurus is one of the many Static Site Generator (SSG) that [Clever Cloud automatic build](/developers/doc/applications/static/#static-site-generators-ssg-auto-build) supports in the `static` runtime, you don't have anything special to manage. To use a pico instance with a dedicated build instance change it in the [Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com) or with Clever Tools:

```bash
clever scale --flavor pico

# To select a bigger build instance, use:
clever scale --build-flavor M
```

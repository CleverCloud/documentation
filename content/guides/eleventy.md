{{< hextra/hero-subtitle >}}
  Eleventy (11ty) is a simple static site generator that allows you to create fast, modern websites with minimal configuration.
{{< /hextra/hero-subtitle >}}

## Requirements

If you need an example source code, get [11ty base blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog), you'll need [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog myStaticApp
```

{{% content "static-create" %}}

### Environment variables

Next, configure the application with a pico instance with dedicated build, enough for a simple website. As Clever Cloud is based on standards, you only need to define a few variables:

```bash
clever scale --flavor pico

# To select a bigger build instance, use:
clever scale --build-flavor M

clever env set CC_WEBROOT "/_site"
clever env set CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK "npm install"
clever env set CC_BUILD_COMMAND "npx @11ty/eleventy"
```

## Quickstart

### Clone this repo

To begin your journey with the Clever Cloud Documentation, you need to clone this repo.

Check your Go version, it need to be above go `1.21.1`.

### Start locally

To start you can build the project with the command `hugo`. This will generate the files of the static site inside the folder called `/public/` at the root of the project.

To run the site in your browser, there is a server built in Hugo you can summon with:  
`hugo server`  
A bunch of option a available:

```bash
 -b, --baseURL string         hostname and path to the root
  -D, --buildDrafts            include content marked as draft
      --cacheDir string        filesystem path to cache directory
      --cleanDestinationDir    remove files from destination not found in static directories
  -c, --contentDir string      filesystem path to content directory
      --disableFastRender      enables full re-renders on changes
```

## Project basic configuration and architecture

The theme used here is called [Hexa](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/).

The `hugo.sh` script will run the compilation with the right options and server the content of the public folder.

This is why the Clever Cloud application running this app needs to have a webroot serving `/public/`.

### Linting Markdown

Hugo uses [Goldmak](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark), a Markdown parser written in Go, compliant with CommonMark 0.30(see [the specification here](https://spec.commonmark.org/)).

Therefore, for better readability and maintaining, all markdown files for this project are linted with <https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2>.  
We strongly recommend that you follow the validation rules described here: <https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint#rules--aliases>.

This linter can be downloaded and run locally, or used via VSCode:

- <https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint> for VSCode
- <https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2> as a NPM package

#### Linting Configuration

**Ignored markdown files** are listed in the `.markdownlintignore`.  
**Ignored specifications**, such as some HTML tag of webcopponents, are configured in the `.markdownlint.jsonc`

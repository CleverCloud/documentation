Clever Cloud has its own SSO (Single Sign-On) authentication to authenticate to various services. All members of your organisation will be able to authenticate to the services in the same organisation, using their Clever Cloud account. When a service needs to authenticate you, it redirects to a login form. Enter your Clever Cloud credentials as well as your 2FA Authentication code if needed.

If it's the first time you use the Clever Cloud SSO, accept all the tokens permissions listed, otherwise the backend service might not work correctly. If you mistakenly disabled some rights at some point, you have to revoke all tokens generated by this OAuth consumer:

1. First, go to your user's OAuth token in the [Web console](https://console.clever-cloud.com/users/me/oauth-tokens)
2. Then, find all tokens named `Keycloak Consumer` and revoke them
3. Try to log-in again. The rights list should now be displayed.

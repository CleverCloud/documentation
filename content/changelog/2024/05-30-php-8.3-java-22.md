We've updated some of our images and deployed them without any impact for our users. You can now set `CC_PHP_VERSION` to `8.3`. It's the default version for new PHP applications. If `CC_PHP_VERSION` is set to `8`, version 8.2 is still used. We also start to warn you if you use a [deprecated](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) PHP version, older than `8.1`. Other changes include:

* **Common:**
  * Linux kernel 6.8.11 (PHP is still 6.8.6)
  * Node.js 20.14.0 as default version
* **.Net, Go, Rust:**
  * Fix for crons
* **.Net:**
  * Fix for deployment issues with 8.x branch
* **Java:**
  * Support for Java 22 (non LTS)
  * Support for NewRelic with Java 22
* **PHP:**
  * Composer 2.7.6
  * Support for PHP 8.3 with [all supported extensions](/developers/doc/applications/php/#available-extensions-and-modules)
  * PHP info apps are available for PHP [8.0](https://php80info.cleverapps.io), [8.1](https://php81info.cleverapps.io), [8.2](https://php82info.cleverapps.io) and [8.3](https://php83info.cleverapps.io)

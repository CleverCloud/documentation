Otoroshi is now in General Availability (GA), with access [to the operator API](/developers/api/v4/#operators). Deployed version is `v16.24.0_1740754279`. The LLM extension includes new models filtering tools and pre-defined context per endpoint. To update, just set `CC_OTOROSHI_VERSION` of the add-on's Java application to `v16.24.0_1740754279` and rebuild it. You can also delete `CC_OTOROSHI_APIM_VERSION`, `CC_OTOROSHI_SECRET` variables from the Java application, they are not used anymore.

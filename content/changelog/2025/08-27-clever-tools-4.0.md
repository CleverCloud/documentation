Clever Tools 4.0 is available. It's a new major version as there are multiple breaking changes. Not in commands nor behavior, but in runtime, code quality and tooling. This release is now based on Node.js 22 and [Clever Cloud JS client 11.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clevercloud/client).

Under the hood we've also :
- Updated [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [README](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools/blob/master/README.md) files
- Removed lots of dependencies, updated those remaining
- Added scripts and tools to ease the development and contribution
- Renewed the complete CI/CD for checking, packaging and distribution steps
- Removed publishing to Chocolatey, we now use WinGet as Windows package manager
- Used `yao-pkg` for compilation, with native Apple Silicon version for macOS users
- Added TypeScript types via JSDoc (CI scripts only for now), quality code tools configuration (ESLint, Prettier)

These changes will pave the way for future major improvements and new features as we'll be able to iterate faster. Thus, we'll progressively introduce new commands management and better UX in the coming months.

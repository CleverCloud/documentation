[PostgreSQL 18](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-18-released-3142/) is available on Clever Cloud, with the same default extensions enabled for PostgreSQL 17. This release comes with `io_uring` for asynchronous I/O, better performance, [virtual generated columns](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/sql-createtable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-PARMS-GENERATED-STORED), UUIDv7 generation, improved text processing and multiple authentication and security features.

You can simply test it with a new add-on or update an existing one through automatic and safe Clever Cloud's migration process.

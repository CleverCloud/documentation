pipx mkdocs new myStaticApp

### Automatic build

MkDocs is one of the many Static Site Generator (SSG) that [Clever Cloud automatic build](/developers/doc/applications/static/#static-site-generators-ssg-auto-build) supports in the `static` runtime, you don't have anything special to manage. To use a pico instance with a dedicated build instance change it in the [Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com) or with Clever Tools:

```bash
clever scale --flavor pico

# To select a bigger build instance, use:
clever scale --build-flavor M
```

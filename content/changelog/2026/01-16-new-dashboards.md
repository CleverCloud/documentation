When you deploy Config Provider, Elasticsearch, Jenkins, Materia KV, or Pulsar on Clever Cloud, you now have access to a better dashboard to manage it. These dashboards provide direct access to admin web panel, Grafana dashboard, management tools such as [KV Explorer](/doc/addons/materia-kv/#clever-cloud-kv-explorer), credentials or deployed version. They also allow to edit name, tags, etc.

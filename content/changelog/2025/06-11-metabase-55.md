The `x.55` branch of Metabase is now available on Clever Cloud. It brings a new visualizer, faster and easier to use, database routing, the new search algorithm as default and many more features. To update, just set `CC_METABASE_VERSION` of the add-on's Java application to `0.55` for the community edition or `1.55` for the enterprise edition (EE).

You can also use [the new Clever Tools commands](/developers/doc/cli/operators/), introduced in `3.13.0` release:

```bash
clever features enable operators

clever metabase version check yourMetabaseNameOrId
clever metabase version update yourMetabaseNameOrId
clever metabase version update yourMetabaseNameOrId 0.55
```

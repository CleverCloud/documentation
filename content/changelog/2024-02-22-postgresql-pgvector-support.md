PostgreSQL databases managed by Clever Cloud come with [lots of extensions enabled by default](/doc/addons/postgresql/#default-extensions). There are also [some you can ask for](/doc/addons/postgresql/#on-demand-extensions), and we'll set them up, like `pg_cron`, `pgtap` or `timescaledb`.

We recently noticed an increased interest from our clients in supporting the `pgvector` extension, needed for specific (AI) workloads. To answer these needs, we've packaged it and are now able to provide it on-demand.

If you need `pgvector`, open a ticket to our support team through [the Console Ticket Center](https://console.clever-cloud.com/ticket-center-choice). If you need any other extension, feel free to ask, we will try our best to respond to your use-case.

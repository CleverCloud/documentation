Apache Pulsar is out of Beta on Clever Cloud. It doesn't change anything for existing add-ons as we consider it stable for some months, except for billing:

- In the January invoice (for December usage), you'll see your Pulsar consumption, still free
- Pulsar will be a paid service starting January 1, 2026

## New Apache Pulsar pricing

Monthly prices will be as follows:

| Traffic IN/OUT | Price per GB |
|--------|--------------|
| < 512 MB | Free |
| 512 MB - 100 GB | €0.800 |
| 100 GB - 500 GB | €0.500 |
| 500 GB - 5 TB | €0.400 |
| > 5 TB | €0.300 |

| Hot Storage (SSD) | Price per GB |
|--------|--------------|
| < 256 MB | Free |
| 256 MB - 50 GB | €0.200 |
| 50 GB - 250 GB | €0.150 |
| 250 GB - 1 TB | €0.120 |
| > 1 TB | €0.100 |

| Cold Storage (HDD) | Price per GB |
|------|--------------|
| All volumes | €0.015 |

In the coming weeks, we will update the Pulsar dashboard and product page to reflect these changes.

We've upgraded the applications' Domains page in the Console. It's now more clear, complete and easy to use. We designed it to highlight some of our underrated features such as [path routing](/developers/doc/administrate/domain-names/#path-routing). You also now have:

- A unique form to add a custom domain or a test domain (`cleverapps.io`)
- A unique list of test and custom domains
- A direct link to add your own certificate
- Clearer error messages/warnings
- Clearer instructions about DNS configuration and IP lists
- Better accessibility, responsiveness, internationalization

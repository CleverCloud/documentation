This page will explain you how to set up your application to run it on our service.

## Troubleshooting your application

If you are often experiencing auto restart of your Node.js instance, maybe you have an application crashing that we automatically restart.
To target this behaviour, you can gracefully shutdown with events handlers on `uncaughtExeption` `unhandledRejection` `sigint` and `sigterm` and log at this moment so you can fix the problem.

As Redis™ is [open source again](https://antirez.com/news/151), we're able to provide release `8.0.0`. It's now available for each new deployment. You can easily migrate an existing instance from [Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com). This new branch brings performance improvements, new features, and bug fixes.

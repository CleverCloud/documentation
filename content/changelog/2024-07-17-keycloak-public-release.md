Clever Cloud provides a Keycloak add-on, developed with Please Open-it, for some months in private alpha. We're releasing it publicly, with a new version and some fixes. Any Clever Cloud user can now deploy a Keycloak service from [API](/api/), [Clever Tools](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools) or [Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com) and use it. If you have any question or feedback, use our [GitHub Community space](https://github.com/CleverCloud/Community/discussions/categories/keycloak).

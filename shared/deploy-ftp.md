## FTP Deployment

Make sure you have [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or an other FTP software installed in your machine.

When you chose to deploy your application via FTP at the application creation, the system creates a free [FS Bucket](/developers/doc/addons/fs-bucket) with an ID matching your application's ID.

Find the FTP credentials in the configuration tab of this particular FS Bucket.

Just follow the instructions of your FTP Software to send code to Clever Cloud.

⚠️ **An FTP application automatically starts once you create the application, even if you don't send any code yet.**

Refer to  [Quick Start - FTP deployment](/developers/doc/quickstart#ftp-deployment) for more details.

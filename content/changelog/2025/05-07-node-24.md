2025 is an important year for Node.js ecosystem with big changes for multiple branches:
- 18.x LTS is end-of-life since April 30th and won't receive any new security updates
- 20.x LTS is in maintenance mode and will receive security updates until April 30th, 2026
- 22.x LTS, will enter maintenance mode in October and will receive security updates until April 30th, 2027
- 23.x is in maintenance mode and will receive security updates until June 1st
- 24.x [is now available](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v24.0.0) as the "Current" release. It will be LTS starting October and supported until April 2028

In Clever Cloud runtimes, we use the latest LTS version by default. Thus, it's currently 22.x, and we'll move to 24.x in October. Until then you can use 24.x branch by setting the `CC_NODE_VERSION` environment variable to `^24`, `24` or `24.0`, for example:

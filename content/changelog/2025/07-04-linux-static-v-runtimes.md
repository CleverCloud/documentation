You can now deploy your applications using the new `linux`, `static` and `v` runtimes on Clever Cloud:
- `linux` is a general purpose runtime that supports any language, and fully takes advantage of the [Mise package manager](https://mise.jdx.dev/)
- `static` is a lightweight runtime for static sites, with auto-build for many static site generators (SSG)
- `v` is a runtime for applications written in the [V programming language](https://vlang.io/)

As they are new runtimes, help us improve it by reporting any issue or suggestion on the [Clever Cloud Community](https://github.com/CleverCloud/Community/discussions/categories/paas-runtimes).

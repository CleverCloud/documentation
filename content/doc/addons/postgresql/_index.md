## Overview

PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and on standards-compliance.

## Supported Versions

{{< software_versions_shared_dedicated pg>}}

{{% content/db-backup %}}

## Migrating from an old database

Some applications require a non-empty database to run properly. If you want to import your **SQL** dump, you can use several methods:
1. [WebGUI (Adminer)](https://dbms-adminer.clever-cloud.com/)
2. Command line tool for PostgreSQL administration like `psql`
3. Any PostgreSQL client such as [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)

## Replication

You can add up to 2 replicas to an existing PostgreSQL (v12 or higher) database on Clever Cloud to enhance performance and reliability. They're set up as read-only [standby servers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-REPLICATION-STANDBY) with full physical replication, in a different availability zone (AZ) or region if requested.

You can see if a database is a [primary server](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-REPLICATION-PRIMARY) or a replica from PostgreSQL dashboard in [the Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com). If a primary server isn't available, you can promote a replica as a standalone server and link it to applications. This database will:
- Become a primary server (using `pg_ctl promote` command internally) with read/write capabilities
- Delete its replication link to the original primary server

> [!Note] Replication setup isn't yet available from API or the Console
>  To create and configure PostgreSQL replicas, contact your sales representative or [Clever Cloud support](https://console.clever-cloud.com/ticket-center-choice).

## Direct access

A proxy serves all dedicated PostgreSQL databases. In some cases, this can add some latency between applications and their database. If this is an issue, you can generate a direct hostname and port for the add-on to bypass the proxy, using the "Generate direct hostname and port" button in the add-on dashboard.

Generating direct access adds new variables to the add-on's environment, allowing connections without going through the proxy.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Direct access doesn't persist after migrating a database. Manually re-generate direct host name and port after a migration to allow applications linked through direct access to connect to the database.

Such a limitation doesn't exist when using proxy access.

## Encryption at rest

Encryption at rest is available on PostgreSQL. You can find more information on the [dedicated page]({{< ref "doc/administrate/encryption-at-rest.md" >}})

## Note on shared databases

If you try to list the databases on the shared cluster, you will see the names of the databases of all other users of the cluster. This is normal behaviour. Rest assured, permissions are set properly, meaning no one but your user can read or write data to your database.

This referencing does not exist for dedicated databases.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
On-demand extensions aren't available for DEV plans.
{{< /callout >}}

## Automatic vacuuming

[Autovacuum](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html) is automatically enabled on PostgreSQL add-ons.
The autovacuum will proceed when a given percentage of rows of a table will be updated/inserted/deleted.
Usually this threshold is set to 20%.

## `pg_activity`

If you want to use [pg_activity](https://github.com/dalibo/pg_activity) on a PostgreSQL add-on, but you encounter the following error `Exception: Must be run with database superuser privileges.`, you need to add the `--rds` flag when you start it.

## ðŸ”‘ Rights and permissions

Add-ons are managed services, meaning that users have **standard access** to the database (role **owner**). Some operations like databases and users creation, as well as some settings modifications aren't available by default. This ensures optimal performances and security for managed services as configured by Clever Cloud.

Authorized actions:
- Manage tables (create, deleteâ€¦).
- Manage schemas.
- Manage indexes.
- Access information from **pg_catalog** (except **pg_database** on DEV plan).
- Access to basic maintenance operations such as *VACUUM* and *ANALYZE*.

If you think your system might require more advanced administrative access, [contact Clever Cloud support](https://console.clever-cloud.com/ticket-center-choice) to explain your use case, and we will work with you to find a solution.

Here is the list of actions that you won't be able to perform:
- Database administration (for example you won't be able to create new databases).
- Users administration (you won't be able to create other users than the one handled with our control plane, i.e. the base owner and read-only users).
- Server configuration update.
- Extensions installation.
- Replica creation.
- Back-up frequency or retention control.

Ask Clever Cloud support if you want to perform one of these actions.

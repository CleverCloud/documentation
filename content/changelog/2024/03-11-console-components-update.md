In our ongoing effort to improve our [Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com) experience, we upgraded some of its components. It now uses [JS Client 8.2.0](../02-27-js-client-8.2.0/) and [Web Components 13.0.0](../03-07-web-components-v13/). This update also brings some fixes regarding deployment logs links and Warp10 calls.

[The release 26.4.0](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/26.4.0) of Keycloak is available on Clever Cloud. It brings multiple bug fixes and great new features:

- Authorization server for MCP
- Passkeys are now seamlessly integrated
- Automatic certificate management for SAML clients
- Federated client authentication is available in preview
- FAPI 2.0 Security Profile and Message Signing Final support
- OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP) is now fully supported

The Clever Cloud Keycloak add-on now includes a plugin that allows filtering email domains when users register.

This release is now used as default for new created add-ons. To update an existing add-on, set `CC_KEYCLOAK_VERSION` of its Java application to `26.3.3` and rebuild it. You can also use [the new Clever Tools commands](/doc/cli/operators/), introduced in `3.13.0` release:

```bash
clever features enable operators

clever keycloak version check yourKeycloakNameOrId
clever keycloak version update yourKeycloakNameOrId
clever keycloak version update yourKeycloakNameOrId 26.4.0
```

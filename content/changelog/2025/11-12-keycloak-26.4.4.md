[The release 26.4.4](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/26.4.4) of Keycloak is available on Clever Cloud. It brings multiple enhancements and bug fixes. Starting with this release, Keycloak is deployed with two new plugins:
- [Groups regexp mapper](https://github.com/please-openit/keycloak-groups-regexp-mapper): map groups that only fit to a regexp (by name), it avoids mapping all user groups into a token
- [HTTP Get request mapper](https://github.com/please-openit/keycloak-http-get-request-mapper): add a result from an external service (HTTP GET request) to user's tokens

You can update through add-on’s dashboard in the [Clever Cloud Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com). You can also set `CC_KEYCLOAK_VERSION` of the underlying Java application to `26.4.4` and rebuild it, or use [Clever Tools](/doc/cli/operators/):

```bash
clever features enable operators

clever keycloak version check yourKeycloakNameOrId
clever keycloak version update yourKeycloakNameOrId
clever keycloak version update yourKeycloakNameOrId 26.4.4
```

Redis™ `7.2.4` is now available for each new deployment. You can easily migrate an existing instance from [Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com).

## Security fixes

* (CVE-2023-41056) In some cases, Redis™ may incorrectly handle resizing of memory buffers which can result in incorrect accounting of buffer sizes and lead to heap overflow and potential remote code execution.

## Bug fixes

* Fix crashes of cluster commands clusters with mixed versions of 7.0 and 7.2 (#12805, #12832)
* Fix slot ownership not being properly handled when deleting a slot from a node (#12564)
* Fix atomicity issues with the RedisModuleEvent_Key module API event (#12733)

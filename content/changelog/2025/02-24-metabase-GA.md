Metabase is now in General Availability (GA). Deployed version is `x.53.4` and you now have access [to the operator API](/developers/api/v4/#operators). To update, just set `CC_METABASE_VERSION` of the add-on's Java application to `0.53` for the community edition or `1.53` for the enterprise edition (EE) and rebuild it.

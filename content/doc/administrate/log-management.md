Clever Cloud new logs stack is based on Vector and Apache Pulsar. This Web Component allow you to check for live or past logs. You can target a specific time window, select logs lines and copy them in clipboard through keyboard and/or mouse. It's not available for add-ons yet.

There are two text filter modes: exact match (case-sensitive) and regular expression. Settings panel offers lots of parameters such as dark/light themes, line wrapping, ANSI codes escaping, etc. You can also choose the date/time format, UTC or local, to show the instances name or not.

This interface is constantly improving, send us your feedback through our GitHub Community:

{{< callout type="info">}}
Logs are retained for 7 days, sometimes more for specific customers/needs.
{{< /callout >}}

## Get continuous logs from your application

Log management is also available through [Clever Tools](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools) and our [APIv4](/developers/api/v4/#logs). They're collected and sent through the Vector service enabled in every application deployed on Clever Cloud. To disable it, set the `CC_PREVENT_LOGSCOLLECTION` environment variable to `true`. You can see logs with the command down below.

```bash
clever logs
```

You can add `--since`, followed by a duration or a date (ISO8601 format). The `--until` flag should be followed by a date (ISO8601 format).

```bash
clever logs --since 2h
clever logs --until 2024-04-15T13:37:42Z
```

You can also get your add-on's logs by using `--addon` flag, the value must be the add-on ID starting by `addon_`.

```bash
clever logs --addon <addon_xxx>
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
   With add-ons, only the last 1000 lines of logs are got by `clever logs`.
{{< /callout >}}

### Access logs

It contains all incoming requests to your application. Here is an example:

```txt
255.255.255.255 - - [06/Feb/2020:07:59:22 +0100] "GET /aget/to/your/beautiful/website -" 200 1453
```

They are available in different formats, the most common is CLF which stands for Common Log Format.

You can see access logs with the following command:

```bash
clever accesslogs
```

As with the `logs` command, you can specify `--before` and `--after` flags.
If you don't specify any options, the logs display continuously.

To change the output, specify the `--format` flag with one of these values:

- simple: `2021-06-25T10:11:35.358Z 255.255.255.255 GET /`
- extended: `2021-06-25T10:11:35.358Z [ 255.255.255.255 - Nantes, FR ] GET www.clever-cloud.com / 200`
- clf: `255.255.255.255 - - [25/Jun/2021:12:11:35 +0200] "GET / -" 200 562`
- json:

  ```json
    {
        "t":"2021-06-25T10:11:35.358209Z",
        "a":"app_xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "adc":"clevercloud-adc-nX",

        "scheme":"HTTPS",

        "r":"01F91AEG8Z9RJKYB7JY7H56FNB",
        "tlsV":"TLS1.3"
    }
  ```

## Exporting logs to an external tool

You can use the logs drains to send your application's logs to an external server with the following command.

```bash
clever drain create [--alias <alias>] <DRAIN-TYPE> <DRAIN-URL> [--username <username>] [--password <password>]
```

Where `DRAIN-TYPE` is one of:

- `TCPSyslog`: for TCP syslog endpoint;
- `UDPSyslog`: for UDP syslog endpoint;
- `HTTP`: for TCP syslog endpoint (note that this endpoint has optional username/password parameters as HTTP Basic Authentication);
- `ElasticSearch`: for Elasticsearch endpoint (note that this endpoint requires username/password parameters as HTTP Basic Authentication);
- `DatadogHTTP`: for Datadog endpoint (note that this endpoint needs your Datadog API Key).

You can list the currently activated drains with this command.

```bash
clever drain [--alias <alias>]
```

And remove them if needed

```bash
clever drain remove [--alias <alias>] <DRAIN-ID>
```

If the status of your drain appears as `DISABLED` without you disabling it, it may be because it haven't been able to send your application logs to your drain endpoint or because the requests timed out after **25 seconds**.

Use the logs drain to send your add-on's logs by using `--addon` flag, the value must be the add-on ID starting by `addon_`.

### Elasticsearch

ElasticSearch drains use the Elastic bulk API. To match this endpoint, specify `/_bulk` at the end of your Elasticsearch endpoint.

```bash
clever drain create ElasticSearch https://xxx-elasticsearch.services.clever-cloud.com/_bulk --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD
```

Each day, we will create an index `logstash-<yyyy-MM-dd>` and push logs to it.

#### Index Lifecycle Management

Depending on the amount of logs generated by your application, you might want to manage the lifecycle of your log indexes to prevent your Elasticsearch instance from running out of storage space.

To do so, Elasticsearch provides a feature called [Index Lifecycle management](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-lifecycle-management.html) that allows you to create a policy to delete indexes based on their creation date.

With our Elasticsearch add-on, you can choose to create a Kibana application in which you can create the policy and apply it to your indexes with an index template, but you can create them manually through API requests.

Here is an example that will create a policy to delete indexes older than 30 days:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://username:password@xxx-elasticsearch.services.clever-cloud.com/_ilm/policy/logs_drain?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "30d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

An index template example to apply the policy based on an index pattern:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://username:password@xxx-elasticsearch.services.clever-cloud.com/_index_template/logs_drain?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "index_patterns": ["logstash-*"],
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "index.lifecycle.name": "logs_drain"
    }
  }
}
'
```

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/set-up-lifecycle-policy.html).

### Datadog

To create a [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/fr/api/latest/logs/#send-logs) drain, you just need to use:

```bash
clever drain create DatadogHTTP "https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.com/v1/input/<API_KEY>?ddsource=clevercloud&service=<SERVICE>&hostname=<HOST>"
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Datadog has two zones, **EU** and **COM**. An account on one zone is not available on the other, make sure to target the right intake endpoint (`datadoghq.eu` or `datadoghq.com`).
{{< /callout >}}

### NewRelic

To create a [NewRelic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/) drain, use:

```bash
clever drain create NewRelicHTTP "https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1" --api-key "<API_KEY>"
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
NewRelic has two zones, **EU** and **US**. An account on one zone is not available on the other, make sure to target the right intake endpoint (`log-api.eu.newrelic.com` or `log-api.newrelic.com`).
{{< /callout >}}

### OVHcloud Logs Data Platform

To export logs from an application or an add-on to [OVHcloud Logs Data Platform](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/en-ie-logs-data-platform-quick-start?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0055819), use the following setup:

- A **TCP** drain log with `clever drain create TCPSyslog`
- Your Logs Data Platform **host** with **port** `514` (SSL ports aren't supported for TCP drains)
- The **write token** for your stream (provided on your Logs Data Platform console)

On your terminal, use the following command:

{{< tabs items="Application,Add-on" >}}

  {{< tab >}}**Exporting logs from an application**:

  ```shell
  clever drain create TCPSyslog tcp://<host>:514 -app <application-id-or-name> --sd-params="X-OVH-TOKEN=\"<token>\""
  ```

  Replace the following values:

  - `<host>`
  - `<application-alias>`
  - `<token>`

  {{< /tab >}}

  {{< tab >}}**Exporting logs from an add-on**:

  ```shell
  clever drain create TCPSyslog tcp://<host>:514 -addon <addon_id> --sd-params="X-OVH-TOKEN=\"<token>\""
  ```

  Replace the following values:

  - `<host>`
  - `<addon_id>`
  - `<token>`

  {{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

### Community software

{{< callout type="info">}}
Community software isn't directly supported by Clever Cloud. It's developed by our community. We don't guarantee their maintenance or correct functioning.
You are better off opening issues on their GitHub repositories than contacting Clever Cloud support.

#### HTTPS-based solution

Some tools available on GitHub enable to create a drain to collect logs through an HTTPS endpoint. [This project](https://github.com/sebartyr/http-logs-drain), for example, is fully compatible with Clever Cloud.

You could host it as an app and an add-on on Clever Cloud. A complete README explains all the features.

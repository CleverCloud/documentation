We updated Elasticsearch Platinum to [release 9.2.1](https://www.elastic.co/docs/release-notes/elasticsearch#elasticsearch-9.2.1-release-notes) which brings multiple fixes, features and enhancements. It's available for add-ons creation and will be used as default starting January 2026.

If you need to migrate an existing add-on to this version, contact [Clever Cloud support](https://console.clever-cloud.com/ticket-center-choice). If you use Elasticsearch 7 or 8, you can migrate them to releases [7.17.29](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/release-notes-7.17.29.html) and [8.19.7](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.19/release-notes-8.19.7.html) respectively.

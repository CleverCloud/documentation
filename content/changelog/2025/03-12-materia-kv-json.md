Materia KV now supports some `JSON` commands :
- `JSON.SET`: sets JSON value at path in key
- `JSON.GET`: gets JSON value at path from key
- `JSON.DEL`: deletes JSON value at path from key

These commands are available for new and already deployed add-ons, with no additional configuration. For detailed examples and usage, see [Materia KV documentation](/developers/doc/addons/materia-kv/#json-commands). If you have any questions or feedback, let's discuss it on our [GitHub Community](https://github.com/CleverCloud/Community/discussions/categories/materia).

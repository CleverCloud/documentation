The [1.2.0 release](https://github.com/CleverCloud/terraform-provider-clevercloud/releases/tag/v1.2.0) of the Clever Cloud Terraform provider is available. It brings multiple bug fixes with some cleaning. It also adds support for Ruby runtime and drains.

There is a format change in domains management:
```
  vhosts = [
    "api.${var.cc_global_tld}/v4/addon-providers/es-addon",
    local.api_v2_vhost,
  ]
```

becomes:
```
  vhosts = [
    { fqdn = "api.${var.cc_global_tld}", path_begin = "/v4/addon-providers/es-addon" },
    { fqdn = "api.${var.cc_global_tld}", path_begin = "/v2/providers/es-addon" }
  ]
```

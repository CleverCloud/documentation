## Overview

This will guide you in the process of creating a "task-only" application that will just
run scalers for the duration of a single task and shutdown these scalers once the task is
done.

## Create a "task" application

### With the Clever Tools CLI

1. Make sure you have clever-tools installed locally or follow our [CLI getting started]({{< ref "doc/cli/getting_started.md" >}}) guide.
2. In your code folder, do `clever create --type <type> <app-name> --region <zone> --org <org> --task` where :
   1. `type` is the type of technology you rely on
   2. `app-name` the name you want for your application,
   3. `zone` deployment zone (`par` for Paris and `mtl` for Montreal)
   4. `org` the organization ID the application will be created under.

With the `--task` flag, your application will be marked as "task" in our internal database.
This means that every deployment will be handled as a task. More on that later.

Refer to [clever create]({{< ref "doc/cli/create.md" >}}) for more details on application creation with Clever Tools.

### With the console

TODO: document how to do it.

### With the `CC_TASK=true` environment variable

You can temporarily deploy a "normal" app as a "task" one.e
You just need to add the `CC_TASK` environment variable with the value `true`.
The deployment will be a "task" one while the variable exists in the application.

## Define the actual command to run (mandatory)

To run your task, you **have to** define a `CC_RUN_COMMAND` variable with the command that
will be executed. If this variable is not set, the task deployment **will not** go through.

### Examples

Here are some example commands to run:

```
CC_RUN_COMMAND="php my-special-script.php"
CC_RUN_COMMAND="python manage.py migrate"
CC_RUN_COMMAND="npm run app:test"
CC_RUN_COMMAND="./my-special-script.sh"
CC_RUN_COMMAND="node my-special-script.js"
CC_RUN_COMMAND="cd mytask; ./task1.sh && ./task2.sh"
```

Note that you can only set **one** `CC_RUN_COMMAND`.
If you need to run multiple commands, separate them with `;`, `&&` or put them in a bash script.

Your environment is loaded before running your commands, so you have access to all the
environment variables you might have set.

## What's in tasks apps? What is not?

"Task" apps are a quick way to run a script.
When deploying, Clever Cloud just starts VMs, run the given command and then stop the VM.

### Current limitation

At the time of publishing this doc, here are some limitations around tasks:

- You cannot deploy the same app multiple times in parallel, executing different tasks.
  We will start the latter one after the former one ends.
- Due to this limitation, running a task deployment on an existing app will block "normal"
  deployments for the duration of the command. Event the ones from the monitoring.
- There is no out-of-the-box cron definition at the moment.
  You'll have to do that on your own.

### Tips and examples

#### Running from a cron

`clever-tools` is available on all our VMs.
You can trigger the deployment of a task by running a few `clever` commands.
For example, you can setup a cron on your web application that runs as a normal app, and
run something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir task
pushd task

# Make sure to have CLEVER_TOKEN and CLEVER_SECRET in your env

clever link {task app_id}
clever restart --quiet # That's if you don't care for the logs to show in here

popd
rm -rf task
```

#### Running a script with different parameters

You can write a script that takes specific environment variables and acts on it.

Let's say your app needs to trigger the processing of a specific file after a customer
uploaded it.

Make your processing script use the value from `FILE_TO_PROCESS` as the source:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

wget "${FILE_TO_PROCESS}" -O "to-process.csv"

process-my-file "to-process.csv"
```

Then in your main app, trigger the task like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir task
pushd task

# Make sure to have CLEVER_TOKEN and CLEVER_SECRET in your env

clever link {task app_id}
clever env set FILE_TO_PROCESS "https://mybucket.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/some-file-20240231.csv"
clever restart --quiet # That's if you don't care for the logs to show in here

popd
rm -rf task
```

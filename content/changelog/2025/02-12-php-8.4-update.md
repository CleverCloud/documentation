We deployed an updated PHP image with no impact for our users.

  * PHP 8.4.3
  * Composer 2.8.5
  * Symfony CLI 5.10.7
  * Linux kernel 6.12.9

You can now use `8.4` as `CC_PHP_VERSION` environment variable, `8.3` is still the default for now.

Only some extensions support PHP 8.4 for now: apcu, amqp, blackfire, event, elastic-apm, gnupg, grpc, imap, mailparse, maxminddb, memcache, memcached, mongodb, newrelic, oauth, pdflib, protobuf pspell, rdkafka, redis, ssh2, solr, tideways, uploadprogress, zip. We'll add support for more extensions as they are released.

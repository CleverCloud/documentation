## Make a payment

In the sidebar of the organization section, there are three alternatives to buy credit for your applications:

* Credit card (powered by Stripe)
* Paypal
* Bank transfer: we accept international bank transfers. This option will generate a reference that you will have to add to your bank transfert, as a note.
* SEPA Direct Debit: we support payment via SEPA debit. More information in the [SEPA Direct Debit section](#sepa-direct-debit)

## Invoices

Invoices are available in the *Invoices* tab in the sidebar of the organization section. Once paid, invoices are moved to the "Paid invoice" table.

### Receive invoices

You can change the billing email for an organization in *Information > Billing details > Billing email*.

Also an organization member with the accountant role can receive invoices as described in the organization [roles](/doc/account/organizations/#roles-and-privileges).

> Debit instructions are issued in the following cases:
>
> * when you confirm an invoice payment;
> * starting 5 days after issuing the invoice, would you set your IBAN as default payment method;
> * would the first debit fail, new attempts will be made every day up to 15 days after invoice issuance and every 5 days after that.

### About invoices issuance and notifications

As explained in the [Monthly Invoice documentation]({{< ref "doc/billing/unified-invoices.md#monthly-invoice" >}}), Clever Cloud issues an invoice at the beginning of every month.
The invoice is emailed to you.
In accordance with SEPA rules and the mandate your agreed to, this email also notifies you that a debit will be attempted 5 days after invoice issuance.

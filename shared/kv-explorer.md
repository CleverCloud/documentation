## Clever Cloud KV Explorer

Access and edit your Key-Value databases with the **KV Explorer** tool, it's part of Clever Cloud's all included experience.

### Supported data types

Hash, list, set and string types are supported. For Materia KV, only string type is currently available, with other types coming soon.

### An intuitive, useful interface

The interface lets you filter keys by type and perform wildcard searches (for example: `*value_to_search*`). Value fields are multi-line for convenience, and you can copy/paste values directly from the interface. Special attention has been paid to accessibility and keyboard navigation with shortcuts to optimize your experience.

### KV Explorer Terminal

At the bottom of the page, you'll find an integrated terminal that works like a traditional CLI client. Type your commands and press Enter to execute them. All commands are supported, including `FLUSHDB` and `FLUSHALL`. Be careful with these as they erase data!

KV Explorer is in Beta testing phase and we'll improve it over the coming months, thanks to your feedback and suggestions.

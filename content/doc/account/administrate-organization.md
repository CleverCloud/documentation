After you create an account, your account is tied to a first organization named as 'Personal Space'. You can use the Personal Space for individual projects or personal use, but only you as a user can access it.

To collaborate with others, manage team access, or handle separate billing for a group, you need to create an organization.

## Create an organization

In the Clever Cloud Web Console, select **Add an organization** in the left menu.

Give it a name, description, specify if it's a company and add billing information.

## Administrate an organization

By clicking on you application name, a new left menu open.

- **Overview**: Simple metrics about your applications within this organization
- **Information**: See and edit organization's name, description, billing address and image. That also is where you can delete your organization.
- **Members**: Manage team members. Team members must have a Clever Cloud account. On this page you can add and remove team members. You can also edit their roles to manage their permissions.
- **Shared software**: It's a section displaying third party software, like [Heptapod](/doc/addons/heptapod/)
- **Payment methods**: Manage provisioning of your organization, manage credit cards and add here potential discount codes or coupons.
- **Invoices**: See your recent invoices.
- **Notifications**: Manage email notifications and web hooks for team members.
- **Consumption**: See metrics about your organization's consumptions.

## Delete an organization

In the **Information** page, click the *remove this organization* button. You're then prompted to enter the name of the organization to confirm the organization deletion.

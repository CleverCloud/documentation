{{< hextra/hero-subtitle >}}
  Clever Cloud provides an automated hosting platform for developers. Deploy your app easily and launch dependencies without having to worry about the infrastructure set up. Follow this guide to get ready to deploy quickly as you learn the basics of Clever Cloud.
{{< /hextra/hero-subtitle >}}

## Clever Cloud applications

An application is defined on Clever Cloud by the following elements:

* a dedicated language/framework;
* a deployment method (FTP and/or Git);
* resources consumption (CPU, RAM, Diskâ€¦), depending on the language or framework used;
* an optional configuration file you may add to your project.

If one of these elements is missing, Clever Cloud can't deploy your application properly (except the configuration file, optional in some cases).

> [!NOTE]
> Clever Cloud runtimes are immutable infrastructure and always start with a fresh, up-to-date, system. If you need persistent storage, use a file storage ([FS Bucket](/doc/addons/fs-bucket/)), object storage ([Cellar](/doc/addons/cellar)) or one of the many Clever Cloud's [database-as-a-service](/doc/addons/).

## How Clever Cloud works

When you push an application's code to git or via FTP, the platform receives it and checks the resource's requirements. If they are complete, the deployment is launched. When finished and successful, the application is up and running.

The log system retrieves all output from the application and displays it in the logs tab of your application in the Clever Cloud console.

## Create a Clever Cloud account

You can sign up for Clever Cloud using your **email** or your **GitHub account**.

Navigate to the [Clever Cloud Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com/), click **Create an account** at the bottom of the page, and select the sign-up method you prefer.

{{< tabs items="Email auth, GitHub auth" >}}

  {{< tab >}}
  You need a valid email address (not a temporary or disposable one) to sign up using email.

* Create a password with at least 6 characters.
* Validate your email address by clicking on the link in the confirmation email from Clever Cloud.
  {{< /tab >}}

  {{< tab >}}
  Use the GitHub sign up to create a Clever Cloud account or link an existing account to GitHub in one click.
  Signing up with GitHub requires permission to read your:

* Public key
* User repositories

  Repository permission lets you deploy GitHub apps to Clever Cloud in one step.
  
  Give the Clever Cloud API access to a specific GitHub organisation in your [GitHub account **Developer Settings**](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/d96bd8fd996d2ca783cc).
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

### Enable two-factor authentication

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) in your [**Authentication** settings](https://console.clever-cloud.com/users/me/authentication).

> [!NOTE]
> Save your recovery codes when Clever Cloud displays them. Without them, you won't be able to recover your account if you lose access to your 2FA device.

## Deploy your code

To deploy on Clever Cloud, you'll create an application in the console, then push your code via Git, GitHub, or FTP.

### Set up a Clever Cloud application

{{< youtube 9ww_t0o-GmA >}}

In the [Clever Cloud Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com/):

{{% steps %}}

#### Select the organization

From the left menu, choose the organization to deploy in. If you only have a **Personal space**, click **Add an organization** to create one.

#### Create an application

In the **Organization manager** panel at the top of the left menu, click **+ Create** and select **Application** to start the creation wizard.

If your account is linked to GitHub, you can select a repository in the wizard.

To deploy an application from a GitHub organization, first [grant the Clever Cloud API access to it](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/d96bd8fd996d2ca783cc).

#### Select the application type

Choose your language or framework.

 {{< callout emoji="ðŸ’¡" >}}
  **Note:** PHP applications can use FTP or Git deployment.
  {{< /callout >}}

#### Configure scaling

**Horizontal scaling** is the number of instances that can run at the same time. **Vertical scaling** sets the minimum and maximum size the instance can be.

[Learn more about scaling and instance size](/doc/administrate/scalability).

#### Give the application a name

Enter a name and description for the application.

#### Optional steps

The wizard will prompt you to configure [add-ons](/doc/addons) and [environment variables](/doc/develop/env-variables), if needed.

{{% /steps %}}

### Choose a deployment method

{{< tabs items="Git,GitHub, FTP" >}}
  {{< tab >}}
  *To deploy via Git, you need it installed on your machine. You can find more information on Git website: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)*

  *Note:* during the deployment, the .git folder is automatically deleted to avoid security problems. If you need to know which version is used on the server please use the `COMMIT_ID` [environment variable](/doc/reference/reference-environment-variables/).

  Follow these steps to deploy your application:

1. Get the git deployment URL in the application information page, which looks like: `git+ssh://git@push.<zone>.clever-cloud.com/<your_app_id>.git`.

2. In your terminal, go to your application repository. If you do not already track your app with git, start by typing:

  ```bash
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "first commit"
```

3. Then, link your local repository to Clever Cloud by providing the Git remote URL:

```bash
git remote add <remote-name> <your-git-deployment-url>
```

4. Push your application to Clever Cloud:

```bash
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>:master
```

  You can see your application **logs** in the dashboard to **monitor the deployment**.

  {{< /tab >}}

  {{< tab >}}
  Once you have created your application with GitHub, each push on the `master` branch trigger a deployment. To deploy an other branch than `master`, go to the `information` panel of your application and select the default branch to use.

  ![GitHub deployment branch select](/images/github-deployment-branch.png "Github deployment branch select")

  If you don't find your repository in the list fetched from GitHub, a workaround is to unlink your account in your profile here : <https://console.clever-cloud.com/users/me/information>, remove **Clever Cloud API** from your GitHub [Authorized OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/applications) and link again your GitHub account to your Clever Cloud account.

  **Private GitHub repositories are also supported.**

  Caution: in GitHub, private repositories in an ordinary user account are an all-or-nothing deal: that is, either someone has full read write access (because they're a collaborator) or they have no access.

  However, if you set up an organisation, create the repository under the aegis of the organisation, and then add the collaborator, you have much more fine-grained control (including giving read-only access to a private repository).
  {{< /tab >}}

  {{< tab >}}
  You can deploy via FTP with PHP applications.

  To deploy via FTP, you need an FTP software installed on your machine. [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) is one of them.

  Deploy your application via FTP, create a [FS Bucket](/doc/addons/fs-bucket) with an ID matching your application's ID. You will find the FTP credentials in the configuration tab of this particular FS Bucket.

  [More documentation about Filezilla](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_%28en%29).

  {{< icon "exclamation-circle" >}} An FTP application is automatically started once the application is created, even if no code has been sent.

  {{< callout type="warning" >}}
  FTP deployment is ok for small websites but not for large ones. We strongly recommend you to use **Git** deployment for **large PHP websites**.
  {{< /callout >}}
  {{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Troubleshooting

{{% details title="Git â‹… Remote is asking for a password" closed="true" %}}

If the remote asks you for a password right after a git push attempt, this may be due to a SSH Key configuration error.

**Add your SSH key to your profile here:**
<https://console.clever-cloud.com/users/me/ssh-keys>

The full tutorial about adding SSH key is here: [adding SSH keys](/doc/account/ssh-keys-management/)

{{% /details %}}
{{% details title= "Git â‹… Unable to resolve the reference master" closed="true" %}}
You are probably trying to push from another branch. Keep in mind that:

* You can only push to the **master** branch for deployment. Trying to push to another branch will trigger an error.
* You cannot push a tag (which refers to a commit) to the remote repository. If you do so, **no deployment** will be triggered.
* In order to push to **master** from a non-master local branch, use this syntax:

```bash
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>:master
```

{{% /details %}}

{{% details title= "GitHub â‹… Does not appear to be a git repository" closed="true" %}}
You can't directly push to an application created on Clever Cloud as a GitHub app: in this case, only the automatic deployment from GitHub is henceforth allowed.

If you try to push to Clever Cloud, as you would do for a non-GitHub app, you will get the following error :

```bash
fatal: '/data/repositories/<app_id>.git' does not
appear to be a git repository
```

Indeed, no git repository is created on Clever Cloud because the application is directly cloned from GitHub.

If you have to push directly to a repository to deploy an application (eg if you deploy from a CI), then create a non-GitHub app.

* **Consumption:** Visualize your application's consumption.

## Add-ons for Clever Cloud applications

Applications often requires one or more services in addition to the runtime itself. Add-ons are services you can use independently, or you can link them with your application(s). For instance, you may want to add a database or a caching system to your application or just have a database with no linked application.

An add-on can be shared by different applications to share data between them. It can be a database shared by two or three applications of your infrastructure for example, or they can be independent.

Most of the add-ons catalog is provided by Clever Cloud, but vendors are also allowed to provide services external to Clever Cloud ([See how to integrate your SaaS with Clever Cloud](/api))

Clever Cloud provides multiple add-ons to work with your applications:

### Databases

### Create your first add-on

**If your add-on:**

{{< tabs items="Doesn't exist yet,Already exists" >}}
  {{< tab >}}
  Here we will assume you want to create a new add-on and link it to your application.

  1. Go to the [Clever Cloud Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com/).
  2. Go to the organisation in which you want to create the add-on, for example your [personal space](https://console.clever-cloud.com/users/me).
  3. Click on **Add an add-on**. This space let you create and configure the add-on according to your needs.
  4. Choose which *type* of add-on you want to create. See preceding the list of available add-ons and their corresponding documentation pages for further information on how they work.
  5. Select the plan you need for you add-on. You can find details about the pricing, the capacity of the add-on and other specifications on this page or in the corresponding documentation page.
  6. Choose with which application you want to link you add-on. Linking an add-on to an application will provide configuration to the application through [environment variables](/doc/reference/reference-environment-variables/). The environment variables provided by the add-on are available for use in the linked application. If you want to use your add-on alone, just don't link it to any application.
  7. Choose the name of the add-on and the region where the add-on will be hosted.
  8. Click on the **Create** button.

  The add-on will now be available in your organisation, and corresponding environment variables will be available for the applications linked to the add-on you just created.
  {{< /tab >}}

  {{< tab >}}
  To link an already existing add-on with your application, just follow these steps:

  1. Go in the organisation of your application.
  2. Click on the name of the application you want to link with your add-on.
  3. Go in the **Service dependencies** section.
  4. Select the add-on you want to link under the "Link add-ons" dropdown menu.
  5. Click on the **Link** button of the add-on you want to link to your application.
  {{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Add-on billing

There are two kinds of billing:

* Per-month billing: Add-ons with fixed resources (storage, CPU and RAM)
* Per-usage billing: Add-ons based on consumption, like [FS Bucket](/doc/addons/fs-bucket) and [Cellar](/doc/addons/cellar)

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Free Plan:** add-ons having a free plan are meant for testing purposes, not production usage. These add-ons usually rely on shared resources, resulting in variable, non-guaranteed performances and stability. Shared clusters may not be running the same version as dedicated instances.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout emoji="ðŸ“Š" >}}
**Your invoice:** per usage billing will be taken on runtime credits each day, while per-month add-ons will create a new line in the monthly invoice.
{{< /callout >}}

### Manage add-ons

Once an add-on is created, at least two tabs are available in the Clever Cloud console:

* **Add-on dashboard:** This screen provides and overview of your add-on and its options, depending on the type of add-on it is.

!["Add-on dashboard"](/images/addon-dashboard.png "Example of an add-on dashboard")

* **Information tab:** This screen sums-up the characteristics of the selected add-on.
The system shows features and environment variables (if applicable).

Other tabs may be available, depending on the add-on type.

### Delete add-ons

To delete an add-on:

1. Go to the **Information** tab of the add-on.
2. Click on *Remove add-on*.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
The system removes all associated data after you delete the add-on.
{{< /callout >}}

PostgreSQL dashboard in [the Clever Cloud Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com) now shows if a database is a standalone server or a replica. For PostgreSQL 12+ add-ons, you can promote a read-only replica as a read-write standalone server.

To set up replicas, ask your sales representative or [contact support](https://console.clever-cloud.com/ticket-center-choice).

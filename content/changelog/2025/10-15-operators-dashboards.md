When you deploy Matomo, Metabase or Otoroshi on Clever Cloud, you now have access to a better dashboard to manage it.

This dashboard provides direct access to admin web panel, useful information such as deployed version, underlying resources, initial user/password, edit name, tags, etc. You can easily rebuild/restart your instance with [Blue/Green deployment](/doc/best-practices/blue-green/), access the Grafana dashboard, transparently update to a new version or enable/disable Network Group when available:

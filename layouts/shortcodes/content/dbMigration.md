## Upgrading to a higher plan

If you find that the resources of your current plan aren't enough, you can upgrade to a higher plan.
You can do it from the console by clicking on your add-on and going to the `Migrate/Upgrade` menu.  

With a migration, you can change to a higher plan, a new version or to another region.
A migration work by creating a new instances and moving your data over to that new instances, the old one is then stopped. In case of a failure during migration, the new instance is deleted and you go back to the original one.
The duration may vary depending on how much data your add-on has. Your database become read only for the entire duration.

If you want to restart your add-on or update to the last supported version of the current branch, migrate it to the same plan, version, zone.

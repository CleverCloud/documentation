If you need an example source code, init a new project (you'll need [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)): 
```bash
cargo install mdbook
mdbook init myStaticApp --title="my mdBook" --ignore=git
```

## Configure environment variables
Next, we configure the application with a medium build instance to quickly generate static files. The host instance is nano-sized, enough for a simple website. As Clever Cloud is based on standards, you only need to define a few variables:
```bash
clever scale --build-flavor M
clever scale --flavor nano

clever env set CC_WEBROOT "/book"
clever env set CC_OVERRIDE_BUILDCACHE "/book"
clever env set CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK "cargo install mdbook"
clever env set CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK "/home/bas/.cargo/bin/mdbook build"
```

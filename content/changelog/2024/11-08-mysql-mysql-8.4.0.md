MySQL 8.4 is available on Clever Cloud. You can deploy it as a new add-on or migrate existing ones. As this is the first release (8.4.0) of this long term support (LTS) branch for the [Percona Server](https://www.percona.com/mysql/software/percona-server-for-mysql) we use, it's tagged as `early`. That means you should consider it mostly to make some tests and discover what's new. But we recommend [waiting a bit](https://www.percona.com/blog/severe-instability-of-mysql-8-0-38-8-4-1-and-9-0-resolved-in-upcoming-releases/) before using a new branch in production.

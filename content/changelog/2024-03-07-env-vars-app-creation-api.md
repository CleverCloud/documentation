When you create an application with the Clever Cloud API, you can now set environment variables directly. This feature is available in the `POST v2/organisations/{id}/applications` endpoint, with an object to set:

```json
"env": {
    "ENV_VAR": "value",
    "ANOTHER_ENV_VAR": "another value"
}
```

The response will contain an `env` object, with the environment variables set: 

```json
"env": [
{
  "name": "ENV_VAR",
  "value": "value"
},
{
  "name": "ANOTHER_ENV_VAR",
  "value": "another value"
}]
```

You can get this object from the applications endpoints, such as `GET v2/organisations/{id}/applications/{appId}`.

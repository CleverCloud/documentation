Our [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) add-on has been updated to version `5.6.1` which is now used by default. It includes improvements, bug fixes, and adds a plugin to detect AI Agents. To use it, activate it in plugins administration parameters. Privacy settings can now be configured independently for each website.

You can deploy this release from our [Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com) or [Clever Tools](/doc/cli/). Existing customers' add-ons are already up-to-date.

The release `16.22.0` of Otoroshi is available on Clever Cloud for new add-ons. [It fixes](https://github.com/MAIF/otoroshi/releases/tag/v16.22.0) some bugs and adds some features such as a plugin to add very simple basic auth, without complex user management, plugins to provide information (metrics, health, etc.) as user endpoint. LLM Extension also contains multiple fixes. To upgrade, edit `CC_OTOROSHI_VERSION` to `v16.22.0`, `CC_OTOROSHI_APIM_VERSION` to `1737449369` in the Java application and rebuild it.

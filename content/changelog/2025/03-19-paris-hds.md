Clever Cloud is HDS-certified for [all six activities](https://www.clever-cloud.com/fr/hebergement-donnees-de-sante/) and you can now deploy on `parhds` zone from the [API](/developers/api/), [Clever Tools](/developers/doc/cli/) or the [Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com). To benefit from certified hosting for health data, you need to deploy in an HDS zone and to sign up to a specific contract. This begins with [an initial discussion with our team](https://www.clever-cloud.com/fr/hebergement-donnees-de-sante/contact-hds/).

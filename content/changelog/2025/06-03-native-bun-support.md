[Since April](/developers/changelog/2025/04-16-images-update/), Bun is included in our images. It helped customers to deploy their applications faster, profit from its native [RedisÂ®](https://bun.sh/docs/api/redis) and [object storage](https://bun.sh/docs/api/s3) support. Starting today, you can deploy your Bun applications on Clever Cloud without any efforts.

If a `bun.lock` file is detected at the root of your project, and you didn't ask for another JavaScript runtime or package manager, your application will be deployed with [Bun](https://bun.sh) as a package manager and runtime. You can also ask for Bun explicitly by setting the `CC_NODE_BUILD_TOOL` environment variable to `bun`.

Want to give it a try? Just launch these commands with Bun and [Clever Tools CLI](/developers/doc/cli/install) installed on your system:

```
mkdir bunDemo
cd bunDemo

git init
bun init --yes --react

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

clever create --type node
clever deploy
clever open
```

You'll get a basic React application running on Bun, deployed on Clever Cloud.

You can now define the paths that the orchestrator will call to validate a deployment for Java applications through one or multiple `CC_HEALTH_CHECK_PATH` environment variables. It works as follows:

* If the application responds on this specified path, and the response code is between `200` and `300`, the orchestrator considers that the deployment has been validated.
* If it responds with another error code outside this interval, the application is considered to have failed its deployment.

Currently, the orchestrator only checks whether the application is listening to TCP port `8080`. It does not always mean that the application has started correctly.

On March 29th, we were informed that a backdoor was discovered in the source code of `xz`, introduced with version 5.6.0 (CVE-2024-3094). Our security team instantly made sanity checks, and found our services were not impacted.

As stated [by NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094), « *Through a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzma build process extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existing in the source code, which is then used to modify specific functions in the liblzma code. This results in a modified liblzma library that can be used by any software linked against this library, intercepting and modifying the data interaction with this library.* ».

First, the malicious version was not deployed on images we use for most of our services. Second, we don't use patches to support systemd within OpenSSH through libsystemd (which depends on the backdoored libzma). Third, some GNU/Linux distributions were specifically targeted, not [Exherbo Linux](https://www.exherbolinux.org/) which we use for our services.

Nevertheless, we immediately put the backdoored version on a deny list to prevent its installation, and so did Exherbo Linux maintainers promptly after. We also started to revert `xz` 5.6.x to 5.4.6 on the few custom services where it had been set up, although it would not have been possible for an attacker to exploit it.

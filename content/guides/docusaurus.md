If you need an example source code, init a new project (you'll need [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)): 
```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest myStaticApp classic
```

## Configure environment variables
Next, we configure the application with a medium build instance to quickly generate static files. The host instance is nano-sized, enough for a simple website. As Clever Cloud is based on standards, you only need to define a few variables:
```bash
clever scale --build-flavor M
clever scale --flavor nano

clever env set CC_NODE_VERSION "20"
clever env set CC_WEBROOT "/build"
clever env set CC_OVERRIDE_BUILDCACHE "/build"
clever env set CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK "npm install"
clever env set CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK "npx docusaurus build"
```

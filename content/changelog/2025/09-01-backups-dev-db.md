We provide free DEV plans for MySQL and PostgreSQL managed databases and will continue to do so to help you discover our platform. However, we'll only provide backups for paid plans starting October 1st, 2025.

If you need a 7-days included backups and production-ready service, consider upgrading from a DEV to [XXS Small Space or an higher plan](https://www.clever.cloud/pricing/).

[Otoroshi v17.1](https://github.com/MAIF/otoroshi/releases?q=v17.1&expanded=true) is available with multiple improvements, bug fixes and a new canary mode plugin with autonomous rollout. LLM extension is updated to [0.0.46 release](https://github.com/cloud-apim/otoroshi-llm-extension/releases/tag/0.0.46) which brings new OVHcloud endpoints, user provided data for ecological/cost tracking, support of multiple models for audio (speech-to-text, text-to-speech), image generation and moderation.

To update just set `CC_OTOROSHI_VERSION` of the add-on's Java application to `v17.1.1_1747324564` and rebuild it.

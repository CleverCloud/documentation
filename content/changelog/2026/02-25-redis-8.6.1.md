We updated Redis™ to [release 8.6.1](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/8.6.1). It brings bug fixes, performance optimizations from [8.6.0](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/8.6.0) and a security patch. Redis™ 8.6.1 is available for new add-ons. Those already deployed can upgrade through migration.

Starting with this release, Transparent Huge Pages (THP) are disabled at startup to prevent latency spikes and memory fragmentation under heavy workloads, in line with [official Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency/).

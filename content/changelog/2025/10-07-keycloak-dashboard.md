When you deploy Keycloak on Clever Cloud, you now have access to a better dashboard to manage it. This dashboard provides direct access to Keycloak admin panel, useful information such as deployed version, underlying resources, initial user/password, edit name, tags, etc. You can easily rebuild/restart your Keycloak instance with [Blue/Green deployment](/doc/best-practices/blue-green/), access the Grafana dashboard, transparently update Keycloak to a new version when available:

## Secured Multi Instances

The Keycloak dashboard also makes Secured Multi Instances directly available from the Console, and not only through [API](/api) or [Clever Tools](/doc/cli). It adds a second Java application instance to your Keycloak which brings more resiliency and availability to your identity management solution. As communication through such cluster use an unencrypted Infinispan connection, a Network Group is automatically created and used to isolate this traffic through a private, encrypted, [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) network.

If you also need a more resilient database, contact your sales representative or [Clever Cloud support](https://console.clever-cloud.com/ticket-center-choice).

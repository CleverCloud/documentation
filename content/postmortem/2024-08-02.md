  A minor release resulted in a cascade of errors that perturbed platform stability and customer service. How it went wrong,what we’ve learnt
{{< /hextra/hero-subtitle >}}

On Friday, August 2nd, 2024 Clever Cloud’s platform became unstable, leading to downtime of varying duration and scope, for many customers. The impact was both on the API itself, and on some services running as add-ons or runtimes.

These events occurred because:

* A planned minor maintenance of the Messaging component has locked the cluster causing an incident ([www.clevercloudstatus.com/incidents/880](https://www.clevercloudstatus.com/incidents/880)) between **2:00 PM CEST** and **2:29 PM CEST**
* As an indirect consequence, the infrastructure experienced I/O and memory pressure between **3:40 PM CEST** and **4:16 PM CEST** causing some hypervisors to crash.

Impacts were observed for customers relying on the EU-FR-1 (PAR) region, and remote zones depending on the EU-FR-1 control plane (OVHcloud, Scaleway, and Oracle). Privates and on-premise zones weren’t impacted.

## Analysis

### Messaging Maintenance (Apache Pulsar)

Apache Pulsar is used as the fundamental layer of messaging. This component has interesting multi-tenancy capabilities and supports very high cardinality of namespace/topics creation. It’s not exempt of bugs, and it regularly receives a fair amount of bug fixes. Minor releases are applied as a rolling upgrade basis. When it happens, topics are handed over from a broker to another. Since the architecture of Apache Pulsar has strong separation between the messaging layer and the storage layer, brokers are stateless and the topic handover is a seamless operation that doesn’t affect connected clients. They will receive a notice that the topic has moved to another broker, and connect to the new one. This is an expected behavior implemented by clients and constantly happening for broker load management, resizing, etc. In our topology, there are additional proxies between customers' clients and brokers, so only proxies are seeing this administrative rebalancing.

In this minor maintenance, we opt in for an optimized balancer named `TransferShedder` instead of the native `OverloadShedder`.

```shell
loadManagerClassName=org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.extensions.ExtensibleLoadManagerImpl
```

```shell
loadBalancerLoadSheddingStrategy=org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.extensions.scheduler.TransferShedder
```

Pulsar scalability is performed through the concept of bundles which are kind of scalability groups to perform administrative tasks. This change also implies moving from the modular bundle unloading strategy to the extensible one. These changes bring many improvements by removing storage on the metadata layer, and having a pre-assignation for the next broker when unloading a topic which shortens the switch from a broker to another.

This new *extensible unload strategy* relies on non-persistent real time replication among brokers. Which means when a first broker is upgraded, it initializes the system topic to synchronize other brokers with load metadata. Unfortunately, the extension failed to initialize properly, and doesn’t create the system topic, but without crashing the broker which will be seen up by our monitoring :

```shell
2024-08-02T08:48:53,344+0000 [CompletableFutureDelayScheduler] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.loadbalance.extensions.channel.ServiceUnitStateChannelImpl - clevercloud-pulsar-broker-c3-n1:8080 failed to wait for owner for serviceUnit:orga_79bb9459-98d7-48bb-91ea-cd64204d8140/logs/0x80000000_0xc0000000; Trying to return the current owner:Optional[clevercloud-pulsar-broker-c3-n1:8443] java.util.concurrent TimeoutException: null

```

Since the monitoring didn’t catch it, the broker was up so the rolling process continued. The more it started, the more they tried to reach the topic metadata, fulfilling the *Lookup requests queue* :

```shell
2024-08-02T08:49:12,448+0000 [pulsar-io-3-5] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.MultiTopicsConsumerImpl - Failed to get partitions for topic to determine if new partitions are added
java.util.concurrent.CompletionException: org.apache.pulsar.client.api.PulsarClientException$TooManyRequestsException: {"errorMsg":"Failed due to too many pending lookup requests","reqId":1946266099531305237, "remote":"clevercloud-pulsar-broker-c3-n9/192.168.2.9:6650", "local":"/192.168.2.9:58654"} Caused by: org.apache.pulsar.client.api.PulsarClientException$TooManyRequestsException: {"errorMsg":"Failed due to too many pending lookup requests","reqId":1946266099531305237, "remote":"clevercloud-pulsar-broker-c3-n9/192.168.2.9:6650", "local":"/192.168.2.9:58654"}
```

Ultimately, the topic has never been properly created and brokers ended up in a state where no topics were loaded :

```shell

When we noticed the fall of the bandwidth on the platform, we understood that no topics were loaded, we rolled back the modification on the unload strategy but we decided to stick with the 3.3.1 release.

Switching back to the old policy is a quick move. Configuration revisions are versioned, and this one in particular was pretty simple, yet we faced a new problem. The new unload strategy created a system topic that was unloadable by brokers because of a metadata conflict. The topic wasn’t assigned to any brokers, and it was a showstopper to initialize: Brokers wouldn’t start… We ended up stopping all brokers to start only one, preventing metadata conflict between them, then it succeeded to load the topic, so that we could finally delete it, unlocking all brokers start process. After that, in less than 10 minutes, all brokers were back to a nominal situation so we started proxies.

It’s worth mentioning that for non minor releases, we use a simulation process that emulates a full environment where we inject changes. This validates upgrades and changes by observing the infrastructure behavior before going to production. This process wasn’t used for minor maintenance upgrades or (apparently) small changes in the configuration profile.

### Hypervisor IO/CPU pressure

The unavailability of the Apache Pulsar messaging layer has led to the buffering of telemetry agents on the Virtual Machines (VMs) running on Hypervisors (Servers). Customers VMs embed an observability agent named Vector ([https://vector.dev/](https://vector.dev/)) we chose for its ability to be very efficient and safe (being written in safe Rust). These agents started to buffer in memory while Messaging service endpoints weren’t available. Even if the format is rather efficient, for small VMs it reached a limit of memory which triggered a lot of memory pressure on the kernel. When it happens, the kernel tries to flush all possible memory, wipes all disk caches, and ultimately remove processes from memory to load them instruction per instruction from disk.

At this stage, this is generating a lot of IO disk pressure on the underlying hypervisor (we noticed ~25Gbps on disks). These small VMs are spreaded globally among our Availability Zones, so we ended up having an overloaded server infrastructure.

Clever Cloud also runs on top of Clever Cloud, which usually has many benefits. In this case, it turned out to be a chicken and egg situation : we needed the scheduler to perform some massive actions and comply with deployments, but the control plane was performing suboptimally and the infrastructure struggled to provide available resources.

### Hypervisor crashes — Kernel Panics

A few minutes after the hypervisors got their load increased, we started to see kernel panics on some of our host hypervisors. Those kernel panics were triggered by the khungtaskd kernel thread. This watchdog thread, living inside the Linux kernel, is responsible for watching all tasks the kernel is handling. It iterates over all the tasks and checks all tasks in the `TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE` state.

The `TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE` state means that a task can’t be interrupted. This is the `D` state you can see in `ps` or `htop`. For example, you can get this state by reading or writing to the disk but there are also other syscalls that can put your process in this state.

If the task is in this state for too long (default is 120s), then khungtaskd dumps a trace of the task (which program caused it, its current callstack, ..) in the kernel ring buffer. In our case, we also chose to panic when we have programs in this state: it usually means the kernel either has a bug or something else is going wrong. This watchdog already helped us multiple times in the past to crash the host before it gets completely unreachable and unpredictable.

Some of our hypervisors had processes stuck in `TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE` for too long, for various reasons: writing to disk, KVM syscalls, .. An analysis of the source code ( [https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.10.3/source/kernel/hung_task.c#L91](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.10.3/source/kernel/hung_task.c#L91) ) confirms our thoughts on the observed behavior.

### Monitoring down → upscale

During the event, the monitoring infrastructure triggered a lot of events for both infrastructure and customer services. We observed almost x3 deployments as usual during that day. Multiple reasons can explain this observation:

* The loss of hypervisors due to kernel panics made a lot of instances unreachable, leading to lots of deployments to honor the contract (e.g. number of minimum instances)
* VMs that were under memory pressure were usually unresponsive and so they were (correctly) seen as unreachable
* VMs that were on overloaded hypervisors might have also been slowed down due to the high CPU usage of the hypervisor. Those VMs had less CPU time to do their usual operations, making their load average increase. Our monitoring took that as an increase of CPU usage and they were ordered to upscale if they were configured to
* Some of our monitoring instances took more time to do their checks because they were overloaded as well. Because the monitoring data was missing due to late checks, it was interpreted as lack of data and so as unreachable VMs, triggering more Monitoring/Unreachable events
* Customers seeing their service unavailable are trying to trigger redeployment of their applications, which adds more scheduling tasks on the infrastructure

Our monitoring infrastructure, by observation of many key metrics (CPU Loads, CPU Steal, Availability, health checks, etc.) triggered a significantly higher rate of deployments, which at the time, wasn’t helping both to chill down the control plane already processing at the best it could and the overall infrastructure already overloaded.

### Soothing the control plane

Once we understood some Virtual Machines (VMs) were inducing an abnormal high load on Hypervisors (HVs), we started to filter out machines that could help to free some resources. All non critical services have been shut down like the Observability platform: We stopped the _Long Term Storage for Observability_ metrics data (our Warp10/FoundationDB cluster). Critical services benefit from In Memory Observability (Warp10 in memory standalones), so this was acceptable to preserve all available resources.

Overloaded VMs were collected, sorted and it appeared they shared a common pattern: they were small VMs with few memory resources. The reason has been covered a few lines above. The process after identifying them is obviously to kill them one by one by the SRE team. Nothing fancy here, but soon we started to regain control over all hypervisors.

## Lessons & enhancements

We’ve learnt many lessons this Friday and we already identified many enhancements we will give to the platform. Sure this kind of incident occurring during a summer holiday period is tricky, but we escalated the problem quickly to call people on holiday as soon as 13:00 CEST. We identified two groups of enhancements. A first one, measurable, and identified as a key infrastructure management where some of the measurement are :

* Pulsar Broker health
* Pulsar Cluster health
* Hypervisor load
* Hypervisor I/O
* Hypervisor reboot (Kernel Panic)
* Zombies VM
* RabbitMQ Broker health
* RabbitMQ Cluster health
* Deployment queue consumption

These measurements give us KPIs to measure where we've been operationally good, and where we have lacked some visibility or reaction. We qualified them with four inputs:

* Time of event
* Time of detection
* Time of decision
* Time of resolution

This factual approach helped to challenge ourselves on established rules and showed we can improve or rethink some part of the infrastructure.

Other topics raised but without KPI analysis:

* Dealing with too many monitoring alerts
* Backup Bastion — a regional bastion is vulnerable
* Control Plane recovery process
* Correlation between monitoring and Orchestration
* Fault domain separation vs multi tenancy
* Rethink for runtime images and the role of the hypervisor
* Isolation for waved release upgrades (Pulsar)

All the above questions and KPIs convert to actionable actions for teams that you may question at any time.

### Actions in progress

Following immediate actions, we created a lot of issues to avoid the same behavior in the future:

* Runtime image redesign / better hypervisor integration
* Regionalized observability for redundancy
* Better profiling for small VMs :
  * Vector configuration
    * `buffer.max_events` / `buffer.max_size` (must be at least 256Mo if `type=disk`)
    * `buffer.type` `memory` (default) → switch to `disk`
    * `buffer.when_full` `block` (default) → `drop_newest`
  * Journald verbosity and `SystemMaxUse`
  * Cgroups restrictions for better process control
  * I/O restrictions for VM manager
* Better zombies VM detection

We don’t face a lot of outages and big issues, because by design, we strive to do a good job of running production applications for our customers. As we grow, challenges grow, and we’re committed to achieve great production SLA because it’s our DNA, our mission: running your production workloads.

This experience will help us become even more reliable and we thank you for your help during this difficult time.

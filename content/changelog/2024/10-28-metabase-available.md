After some weeks of testing, the Clever Cloud's Metabase add-on, developed with [David Sferruzza](https://david.sferruzza.fr/), is available in public beta. Thus, you can deploy the service, from [Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com/users/me/addons/new), [API](/developers/api) or [Clever Tools](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools), and use it in minutes.

It's based on a Java application and a PostgreSQL database. Once deployed you'll get a management URL to create an admin account. Then, just start using Metabase, add your data sources, create your questions and dashboards. You'll get benefits from the Clever Cloud's integration, with scalability options, database backups logs, metrics, easy version and upgrade management.

Feel free to let us know what you think and ask your questions in [our GitHub Community](https://github.com/CleverCloud/Community/discussions/categories/metabase).

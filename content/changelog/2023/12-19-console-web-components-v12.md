Among other changes under the hood, our [Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com) now uses the latest release of Clever Web Components. This v12 paves the way to our new `log` components. It also gives multiple new features with some bug fixes, refactoring and breaking changes.

Links to the new documentation are now available in the Console. They're more precise depending on the `variant` (e.g. PHP/Static), use small icons to boost visibility and are now effective for applications and add-ons:

[TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) certificates (updated, more secure, version of SSL) are necessary to enable secure HTTPS connections between a browser and your application. These certificates can be bought online, or generated by Clever Cloud. In that case, we manage the whole process for you.

There is two ways to get HTTPS for your apps:

- **Let's Encrypt**: Provided by default by Clever Cloud. Free. Nothing to configure.
- **Your own certificates**: If you already have a certificate, you can upload it securely.

## Getting Certificates with *Let's Encrypt*

Clever Cloud automatically generates and renews TLS certificates for your domains. To enable this:

1. Add your domain to the application:
   - Use the Console or
   - Use clever-tools
2. [Configure your DNS records](../domain-names) to point to Clever Cloud's load balancers

{{< callout type="info" >}}
  Note: Certificate generation attempts occur **only during the first 3 days** after adding a domain. To restart this window, remove and re-add the domain to your application.
{{< /callout >}}

### Alternative Options

#### Immediate Certificate Coverage
To avoid any period without certificate coverage (e.g., during migration from another provider):
1. [Upload your existing certificate](#uploading-my-own-certificates) first
2. Let Clever Cloud generate a new certificate automatically when your uploaded one expires

#### Wildcard Certificates
Clever Cloud's automatic certificate generation doesn't support wildcard certificates. For wildcard certificates, you can:
- Generate your own Let's Encrypt certificate
- Purchase a commercial certificate
- [Contact support](https://console.clever-cloud.com/ticket-center-choice) for a quote on managed certificate services

Need immediate certificate generation? [Contact the support team](https://console.clever-cloud.com/ticket-center-choice) for manual activation.

### Cloudflare configuration

If you use Cloudflare to manage your domain, the certificate generation could fail depending on your **SSL/TLS** settings, you will encounter 502 HTTP errors if Cloudflare expects **SSL/TLS** strict mode and automatically redirects to HTTPS.

To prevent this from happening you can create a page rule to bypass this policy as Let's Encrypt needs to access the route `/.well-known/acme-challenge*` via HTTP to generate the certificate:

{{% steps %}}

#### Define a page rule

![Bypass page rule on Cloudflare](/images/doc/cloudflare-page-rule-ssl.png "Create a bypass page rule")

 We also recommend to disable the cache level.

#### Turn off HTTP to HTTPS redirection on Cloudflare

![HTTPS set up on Cloudflare](/images/doc/cloudflare-https-setting.png "Turn off automatic HTTPS redirection")

 You can enable [Force HTTPS]({{< ref "doc/administrate/apps-management.md#edit-application-configuration" >}}) in the information tab of your Clever Cloud application instead.

{{< callout emoji="💡" >}}
**If Let’s Encrypt fails to generate the certificate**, you can test that the acme-challenge url works by running the command below:
{{< /callout >}}

```Bash
$ curl http://<your-domain>/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
test
```

It should return a HTTP 200 OK with the string "test" as the body. If it does not, check your Cloudflare configuration.

## Uploading my own certificates

You can upload certificates yourself: [https://api.clever-cloud.com/v2/certificates/new ↗](https://api.clever-cloud.com/v2/certificates/new)

### Prerequisites

You need to paste a PEM bundle containing (in this order):

- the private key
- the certificate itself
- intermediate certificates (optional)

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
  Only certificates with RSA 2048 and RSA 4096 keys are supported.  
  **ECDSA certificates are not currently handled**.
{{< /callout >}}

You should create a `file.pem` containing:

```text {filename="file.pem"}
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
<the private key>
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<the certificate>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

You may need to mention the algorithm in the footer and header.
For instance, if the previous format doesn't work, try to use  
`-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`

You can add optionnal intermediate certificates by appending them to the file as

```text
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<the certificate>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

You should note that `.pem`` files use the unix way of terminating lines with a single line feed character. Make sure your text editor does the same.

### Certificate Submission Checklist

You `.pem` file must be correctly formatted to successfully upload your certificate. This checklist might help you troubleshoot uncesuccessful certificate submission.

| Certificate Specifications |
|------------------------|
| ✅   The private key is included |
| ✅   Keys lenght are RSA and either 2048 or 4096 |
| ✅   ECDSA is not used to create your certificate |
| ✅   The line feed (LF) characters at the end |
| ✅   The certificate chain include your certificate together with all the intermediary CA certificates that signed it, in that order |

## Sending Certificates Manually

{{< callout emoji="👎" >}}
You should be aware that sending certificates manually is **NOT RECOMMENDED**.  
Prefer another method, such as the certificate generation integrated into *Let's Encrypt*, or using our certificate [upload tool ↗](https://api.clever-cloud.com/v2/certificates/new).  
If you have no other choice, then do not send these files by a means that is not secure. The integrity of your certificate will no longer be guaranteed.
{{< /callout >}}

In the event that you request the installation of a certificate by the support team, this operation will be charged on a one-off basis for each request. Please contact us for installation rates.

### Sharing Certificates via Keybase

Another way to transmit your certificates is Keybase.  
Keybase is an encrypted social networking service providing a key directory that maps social media identities to encryption keys (including, but not limited to PGP keys) in a publicly auditable manner. Additionally it offers an end-to-end encrypted chat, you can use to share sensitive informations, such as SSL/TLS certificates.

If your are a Keybase.io user, you can find us at [keybase.io/clevercloud](https://keybase.io/clevercloud).

### Sharing Certificates via GPG

Email can be a secure way to transfer your certificates **when using a signed and encrypted email with GPG**.
Our dedicated email for receiving certificates is [ssl@clever-cloud.com](mailto:ssl@clever-cloud.com).

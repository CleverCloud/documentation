Azimutt is [an open-source project](https://github.com/azimuttapp/azimutt) we follow for a long time. Created by Loïc Knuchel, it helps you to explore, analyze and manage your database in a pleasant graphical interface. It's a member of the [Clever Cloud startup program](https://www.clever-cloud.com/up-program/), for some weeks and now part of our [Marketplace](/developers/doc/marketplace/). Thus, you can create an Azimutt account, free or with a subscription, directly [from the Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com).

You just have to provide a compatible database URI, hosted by Clever Cloud or not, and start exploring it. Our integration is based on a gateway hosted by Clever Cloud. No credentials are shared with Azimutt, and they're kept safely in your browser.

Feel free to let us know what you think about this tool and if you want a deeper integration in [our GitHub Community](https://github.com/CleverCloud/Community/discussions/categories/dbaas).

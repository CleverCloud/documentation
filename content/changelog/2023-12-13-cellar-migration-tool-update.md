If you want to import your object storage data on Clever Cloud, you can use our open source [Cellar migration tool](https://github.com/CleverCloud/cellar-migration/releases/tag/v2.1.0), written in Rust. Its new release adds support for keep-alive when used from S3 clients and prevents panic if a network error occurs.

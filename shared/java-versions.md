## Available Java versions

Set the environment variable `CC_JAVA_VERSION` to the version you want.

We follow the official Java [roadmap](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html) by supporting both LTS and latest non-LTS versions.

We are using OpenJDK distribution for mentioned Java versions.

Every non-LTS versions where _Premier support_ ends will be removed without warning as you should be able to switch to the next available non-LTS version without any trouble.

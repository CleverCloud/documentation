Clever Cloud's Keycloak add-on, developed with Please Open-it, is now available in public beta. We enhanced user experience, performances and features since [the alpha stage](../07-17-keycloak-public-release/). We revised the default configuration of underlying resources. We now use a `S flavored` Java application with more memory and a XXS Small Space PostgreSQL database which is enough for low-volume needs. Of course, you can change it according to your needs at any time.

The default Keycloak version is now 25.0.6. If you want to upgrade, change the `CC_KEYCLOAK_VERSION` environment variable to `25.0.6` and restart the Java application. You can also add the new `CC_METRICS_PROMETHEUS_PATH=/metrics` and `CC_METRICS_PROMETHEUS_PORT=9000`to access metrics [from Grafana](/developers/doc/metrics/#publish-your-own-metrics).

We plan to upgrade to [26.x](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/tag/26.0.0) in the next few weeks after checking its stability and validating it for our platform.

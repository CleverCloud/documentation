[Clever Cloud JS client 10.0.0](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-client.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1000-2025-03-25) is available. In this release, we cleaned up lots of legacy code and no longer generate CommonJS client as we moved to ECMAScript modules (ESM). `eslint`, `prettier` and `typecheck` are now included and used as part of our quality code check and release process. `ResourceLogStream` class is available to manage for new SSE add-ons logs.

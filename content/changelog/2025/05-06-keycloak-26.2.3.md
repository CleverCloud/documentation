The release `26.2.3` of Keycloak is available on Clever Cloud. [It fixes](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/26.2.3) some bugs and brings possibility to log details and representation to the jboss-logging listener. We updated the Clever Cloud module to comply with the new Keycloak API for 26.x releases.

To update, just set `CC_KEYCLOAK_VERSION` of the add-on's Java application to `26.2.3` and rebuild it.

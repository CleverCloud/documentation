As we're upgrading our infrastructure and load balancers in Montreal, we've added new failover IPs in this region. 

If you configure your domains through CNAME records, this update will be transparent. But if you use A records, switch to CNAME or update your [DNS configuration](https://developers.clever-cloud.com/doc/administrate/domain-names/). Old IPs will continue to work for a while, but we recommend you to update your DNS as soon as possible to avoid any service interruption.

## Git push! 
Once all these steps have been completed, commit your content to the local repository and deploy it:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "First deploy"
clever deploy
clever open
```
You can display your website's URL or add a custom domain to it (you'll need to configure DNS):
```bash
clever domain
clever domain add your.website.tld
```

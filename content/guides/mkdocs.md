If you need an example source code, init a new project (you'll need [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)): 
```bash
# Use pip or pip3 depending on your system
pip install mkdocs 
mkdocs new myStaticApp
```

## Configure environment variables
Next, we configure the application with a medium build instance to quickly generate static files. The host instance is nano-sized, enough for a simple website. As Clever Cloud is based on standards, you only need to define a few variables:
```bash
clever scale --build-flavor M
clever scale --flavor nano

clever env set CC_WEBROOT "/site"
clever env set CC_OVERRIDE_BUILDCACHE "/site"
clever env set CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK "python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade && pip3 install mkdocs"
clever env set CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK "mkdocs build"
```

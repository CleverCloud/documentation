## Environment injection

Clever Cloud injects environment variables from your application settings as mentioned in [setting up environment variables](#setting-up-environment-variables-on-clever-cloud) and is also injecting in your application production environment, those from your [linked add-ons](#linking-a-database-or-any-other-add-on-to-your-application).

### Custom build configurations

On Clever Cloud you can define some build configuration: like the app folder to deploy or the path to validate your application deployment is ready 
To do that follow the [documentation here](/doc/reference/reference-environment-variables/#variables-you-can-define) and add the environement variable you need.

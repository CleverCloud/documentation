We've deployed the [3.2.1 release](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/releases/tag/v3.2.1) of Apache Pulsar on our platform. It brings lots of fixes and some new features. Please note we also added [a new v4 endpoint](/developers/api/v4/#pulsar-policies) in our API to control Pulsar's storage policies (offload, retention).

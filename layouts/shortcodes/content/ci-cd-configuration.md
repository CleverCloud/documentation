### Mandatory configuration

Your repository must contain at least the following variables to use the CLI:

- `CLEVER_TOKEN`
- `CLEVER_SECRET`

Find it in your machine, usually in `~/.config/clever-cloud/clever-tools.json`, after [installing the CLI](/doc/CLI).

⚠️ `CLEVER_TOKEN` and `CLEVER_SECRET` expire after one year. Make sure to set a reminder to inject the new ones to avoid breaking your pipelines.

Created in 2007, Rack has become the de-facto standard for ruby web applications and is used in many frameworks such as Ruby on Rails.

## Configure your Ruby and Rake application

### Mandatory configuration

Be sure that:

* Bundler is installed locally (`gem install bundler`)
* you have a `config.ru` file
* Git (for the deploy part)
* you have a `gems.rb` or `Gemfile` containing your dependencies

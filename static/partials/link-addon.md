## Linking a database or any other add-on to your application

By linking an application to an add-on, the application has the add-on environment variables in its own environment by default.

### On add-on creation

Many add-ons do exist on Clever Cloud, please refer to the full list and check add-ons dedicated pages for full instructions.

During add-on creation, you will see **Applications** screen, with a list of your applications. You can toggle the button to *Link* and click *next*. If you finish the process of add-on creation, the application will automatically be linked to it.

### Add-on already exists

In the Clever Cloud console, under the **Service Dependencies** menu of your application, you can use the *Link addons* dropdown menu to select the name of the add-on you want to link and use the *add* button to finish the process.

You can also link another application from the same page in the Clever Cloud console, using the *Link applications* dropdown menu.

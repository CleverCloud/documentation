We updated Kubernetes to [release 1.35.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.35.0). It brings bug fixes, in-place update of Pod resources, numeric values for taints, OCI images mounted as volumes and is the last to support cgroup v1. Kubernetes 1.35.0 is available for new deployments. Migration of existing clusters will be available soon.

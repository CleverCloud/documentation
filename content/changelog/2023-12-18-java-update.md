Java version 21 is available on Clever Cloud but it was not the default version. We have updated our deployment processes to make Java 21 the default version.  
You can however force another version with the environment variable `CC_PHP_VERSION`.

Read our [documentation for more information about PHP version](doc/applications/php/#choose-your-php-version).

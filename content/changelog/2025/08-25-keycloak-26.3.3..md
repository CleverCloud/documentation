[The release 26.3.3](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/26.3.3) of Keycloak is available on Clever Cloud. It brings Infinispan 15.0.19.Final, Quarkus 3.20.2.1, ensures cache configuration has correct number of owners, fixes [CVE-2025-7962](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-7962) and various bug for improved stability.

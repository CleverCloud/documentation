PHP version 8 is available on Clever Cloud but it was not the default version. We have updated our deployment processes to make PHP 8 the default version.  
You can however force another version with the environment variable `CC_PHP_VERSION`.

Read our [documentation for more information about PHP version](doc/applications/php/#choose-your-php-version).

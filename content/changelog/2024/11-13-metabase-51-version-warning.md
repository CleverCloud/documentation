The `x.51` branch of Metabase is now available on Clever Cloud. To update, just set `CC_METABASE_VERSION` of the add-on's Java application to `0.51` for the community edition or `1.51` for the enterprise edition (EE). We also added a warning message in logs if you modify the version to deploy and restart the application without rebuilding it.

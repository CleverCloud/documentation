For several months, we were preparing our CLI, [Clever Tools](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools/), for big changes. It starts to be ready for prime time with the 3.1.0 release. First, the packaging process moved to GitHub Actions with some improvements:
- You can now get the [list of releases](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools/releases) with a changelog and source code archives
- No more beta channel: you'll be able to test new features easier
- Better process, quicker tests, more releases!

If 3.0.x branch brought new log stack (faster, longer, order), you now get updated runtimes and zones lists [in autocomplete](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#enabling-autocompletion), details about application owner during deployment, `git+ssh` URL in new linked/created applications informations.

`clever deploy` can now be used with the `--same-commit-policy` or `-p` flag to set policy to apply when the local commit is the same as the remote one: `error`, `ignore`, `restart` or `rebuild` (default: `error`).

Of course, there are also some bug fixes. And be prepared: more new features are on the way!

To upgrade Clever Tools, [use your favorite package manager](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools/blob/master/docs/setup-systems.md#how-to-install-clever-tools). For example with npm: 

```
npm update -g clever-tools
clever version
```

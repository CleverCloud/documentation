[Clever Tools 3.7](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools/releases/tag/3.7.0) is now available, with some bug fixes, including `clever curl` in packaged and node versions. We've also enhanced `activity` and `addon`. With the latest, selected plan is now always the cheapest by default at creation.

To upgrade Clever Tools, [use your favorite package manager](/developers/doc/cli/install). For example with `npm`:

```
npm update -g clever-tools
clever version
```
